# Perceptron and Shallow Neural Network

## Introduction

This project is a hands-on practice focused on implementing **Lasso regularization**, **feedforward**, and **backpropagation** in a neural network. All requirements and specifications are provided in the `AssignmentLasso_NN.pdf` file.

Special thanks to the **MS in Data Science program at the University of the Pacific** and **Professor Anahita** for providing the resources and guidance that helped me dive deeper into the field of Machine Learning.

## Environment

This project uses:

```python
Python 3.12.10
```

To install the required packages, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
